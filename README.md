# Advent of Code 2024

The following is a set of solutions for Advent of Code 2024, written by [Alex](https://github.com/delanni).

## Solutions

The solutions folder hosts the year's challenges, not inlcuding inputs, outputs or tasks.

You'll find typescript solutions (after day 7) @ [./src/typescript/solutions](./src/typescript/solutions/).

You'll find the early, javascript solutions (days 1-6) @ [./src/javascript/solutions](./src/javascript/solutions/)

## Tools

The tools folder is a set of scripts/tools to help automate some mundane tasks re: solution management.

## Disclaimer

Use of AI for solving the problems is against the principles of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about#faq_ai_leaderboard). I, however, have been using AI to generate tooling for the project (ahead-of-time, not during solving challenges).
